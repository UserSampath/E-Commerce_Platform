**Setup:**

1. Run the Spring Boot item server: `cd backend/item-server && ./gradlew bootRun`
2. Run the Node.js servers:
    * Order management: `cd backend/order-management && npm start`
    * Delivery management: `cd backend/delivery-management && npm start`
    * User management: `cd backend/user-management && npm start`
3. Run the frontend server: `cd frontend && yarn start`

**Access:**

Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the E-Commerce Platform application.

**Notes:**

* Ensure that all backend servers are running before accessing the frontend.
* Replace `3000` with the actual port number specified during the frontend startup.
* The frontend relies on the backend servers, so ensure they are up and running to experience the full functionality.


# Important Notes
# Ensure that all backend servers are running before accessing the frontend.
# Replace your_port with the actual port number specified during the application startup.
